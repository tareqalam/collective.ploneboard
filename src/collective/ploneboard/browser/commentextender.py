# Patch Comment security to allow access for audio attachment
###


# a) The first option is to allow access or all sub objects, which means that
#    anyone, who can see the comment object, can see all its (non protected)
#    attributes
Comment.__allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects__ = 1

# b) Would be to either provide __allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects__
#    function with check for all possible fields or configure permission
#    for the audio field. Unfortunately, the permission on the field would
#    work only if the field value is acquisition aware, which NamedBlob
#    is not, and therefore the following would not work (and would also
#    prevent option a) from working by making the subobject protected.
